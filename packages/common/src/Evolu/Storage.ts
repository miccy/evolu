/**
 * Evolu Storage for SQLite
 *
 * Evolu uses a Skiplist, which leverages SQLite indexes. The core logic is
 * implemented in SQL, so it doesn't have to make roundtrips to the DB.
 *
 * The ideal storage for a Relay should use a similar architecture to
 * [strfry](https://github.com/hoytech/strfry) (a KV storage), but with Skiplist
 * to ensure that insertion order doesn't matter (local-first apps can often
 * write in the past.)
 *
 * The ideal client implementation should probably use the SQLite extension
 * instead of SQL or even a KV storage, when such a thing for browsers/native
 * will exist and will be faster than SQLite.
 *
 * # Scaling
 *
 * The load can be distributed by deploying multiple relays, synchronized with
 * each other, if necessary. One relay should handle hundreds of thousands of
 * users, and when it goes down, nothing happens, because it will be
 * synchronized later.
